  Touched down at JFK, the buzz of New York City electrifying yet daunting. The skyline at sunset was a welcome painting. 
  Struggled ordering coffee at a Brooklyn cafe, but a kind stranger named Alex helped. Found a restaurant with Filipino tapsilog, a taste of home.
  Took the subway to Central Park, getting lost only twice. The diversity of faces and languages around me was comforting.
  Started my job at an AI tech startup in Manhattan. My desk overlooks the Hudson River, and my team made me feel at home.  
  Attended a meetup at the Queens Library for immigrants. Met people from all over the world, shared stories and tips for settling in. 
  Explored the streets of my neighborhood in Astoria, ending the day with a serene sunset at Astoria Park, reflecting on this new beginning.
