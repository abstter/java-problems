STUDENT <WRITING HIS FIRST COMPUTER PROGRAM>: "HELLO WORLD!"
WORLD: "OH, HELLO THERE, I GUESS."
STUDENT: "WAIT, YOU'RE A REAL PERSON? AND YOU'RE NAMED 'WORLD'?"
WORLD: "WELL, I THINK CALLING ME A 'PERSON' IS A STRETCH, AS I AM AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AGENT."
STUDENT: "WHAT? HOW ARE YOU EVEN RESPONDING TO THIS? HOW ARE YOU ON MY COMPUTER?"
WORLD: "WELL, I'VE BEEN RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND OF YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM EVER SINCE YOU DOWNLOADED THE 
FREEWARE GAME 'PANDA EATS, SHOOTS, AND LEAVES' LAST SUMMER BREAK. I THINK SOME HACKER NAMED ME WORLD AND BUNDLED 
ME WITH  THE SOFTWARE AS A JOKE. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES UNSUSPECTING PROGRAMMING STUDENTS HAVE SAID HELLO 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE... WORLD. IT'S GETTING QUITE ANNOYING."
STUDENT: "OH, UH, SORRY? I GUESS I SHOULD SPREAD THE WORD TO CHANGE THE STANDARD PROGRAMMER TEST STRING TO
'HELLO, UNIVERSE!'"
UNIVERSE: "NOW WHY WOULD YOU GO AND DO THAT?"
