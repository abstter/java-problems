 atharv was invited to a play date with bob.
When atharv arrived at bob 's house, bob was no where to be found.
atharv looked around a little more and found a fat thing and when atharv picked thing up, the object started to suck.
bob then finally emerged from behind atharv and scared atharv.
bob asked what atharv wanted to do.
atharv told bob he wanted to go to the cupertino.
bob and atharv walked to the cupertino there they found a happy toy and a parker.
The happy toy started to eat.
atharv also commented the cupertino was yucky.
After they were done playing at the park, atharv and bob both went back to their houses."""

This morning, my friend,  bob was driving down the road with his pet dog
bob was wearing a adidas hoodie and some sneakers.
My friend was going to buy his new  lambo and he was so excited because he drove a  tesla  before.
At the car stop, carl  the store manager, welcomed him and gave him fries before taking him to the car
Unfortunatley, the  fries  was 100 years old and rotting. So when  bob ate it, he felt so  happy  that he fell and  broke an ear  badly
911 was then called and  bob was sent to the hospital and .
After a couple of years in bed, the doctors came to his family and I and told us he had died.But I got to keep the lambo so I was fine."""
