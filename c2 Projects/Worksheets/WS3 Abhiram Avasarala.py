print('\n *** Problem 6 *** ')

# Write a program that builds a sequence of numbers. The program should start
# by printing 1 and then add 2 to the previous number in each subsequent step.
# The program should stop when it reaches or exceeds 100.

print('\n *** Problem 7 *** ')

# The program is supposed to print all odd numbers from 1 to 20, but it is
# only printing 1 and then hanging/freezing. Fix the bug and add a comment in
# your code identifying the problem and how your fix solved it.

# Buggy code (uncomment to test):

i = 0 # i remains at zero to check that 1 is printed
while i < 20:# This makes sure that 21 isn't printed in this code
    i = i + 1 # By incrementing i by 1 before the if statemnt, you make sure it occurs even with the continue.
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i, end = ' ')
    # Once i becomes 2 (an even number), this line is never reached.
    # The if-condition is always met and the continue statement just
    # keeps executing, continuing the loop indefinitely.
